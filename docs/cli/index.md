# Open Distro CLI

The Open Distro command line interface (odfe-cli) lets you manage your Open Distro cluster from the command line and automate tasks.

Currently, the Open Distro CLI supports the [Anomaly Detection](../ad/) and [k-NN](../knn/) plugins, along with arbitrary REST API paths. Among other things, you can use the CLI create and delete detectors, start and stop them, and check k-NN statistics.

Profiles let you easily access different clusters or sign requests with different credentials. The CLI supports unauthenticated requests, HTTP basic signing, and IAM signing for Amazon Web Services.

This example moves a detector (`ecommerce-count-quantity`) from a staging cluster to a production cluster:

```bash
odfe-cli ad get ecommerce-count-quantity --profile staging > ecommerce-count-quantity.json
odfe-cli ad create ecommerce-count-quantity.json --profile production
odfe-cli ad start ecommerce-count-quantity.json --profile production
odfe-cli ad stop ecommerce-count-quantity --profile staging
odfe-cli ad delete ecommerce-count-quantity --profile staging
```


## Install

1. [Download](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html){:target='\_blank'} and extract the appropriate installation package for your computer.

1. Make the `odfe-cli` file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./odfe-cli
   ```

1. Add the command to your path:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
   ```

1. Check that the CLI is working properly:

   ```bash
   odfe-cli --version
   ```


## Profiles

Profiles let you easily switch between different clusters and user credentials. To get started, run `odfe-cli profile create` with the `--auth-type`, `--endpoint`, and `--name` options:

```bash
odfe-cli profile create --auth-type basic --endpoint https://localhost:9200 --name docker-local
```

Alternatively, save a configuration file to `~/.odfe-cli/config.yaml`:

```yaml
profiles:
    - name: docker-local
      endpoint: https://localhost:9200
      user: admin
      password: foobar
    - name: aws
      endpoint: https://some-cluster.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com
      aws_iam:
        profile: ""
        service: es
```


## Usage

odfe-cli commands use the following syntax:

```bash
odfe-cli <command> <subcommand> <flags>
```

For example, the following command retrieves information about a detector:

```bash
odfe-cli ad get my-detector --profile docker-local
```

For a request to the Elasticsearch CAT API, try the following command:

```bash
odfe-cli curl get --path _cat/plugins --profile aws
```

Use the `-h` or `--help` flag to see all supported commands, subcommands, or usage for a specific command:

```bash
odfe-cli -h
odfe-cli ad -h
odfe-cli ad get -h
```
